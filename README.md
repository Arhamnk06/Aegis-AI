## 🚀 What is Aegis AI?

Aegis AI is a governance-first enterprise platform designed to ingest, classify, prioritize, and structure organizational risk signals across multiple domains — including fraud, misinformation, mental health stress indicators, and infrastructure strain.

Rather than simply detecting risk, Aegis transforms raw signals into structured, auditable, human-approved intervention plans.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Modern organizations face:

- Fragmented risk signals across departments  
- Alert fatigue and signal overload  
- Lack of prioritization  
- No clear ownership  
- Limited auditability  

Aegis AI solves this by turning raw risk data into prioritized, accountable action.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Signal Ingestion

There are two input methods:

### Option A — Upload CSV
Upload enterprise risk signals with the required schema:

- `timestamp`
- `category`
- `severity_score`
- `description`

Before processing, the system:
- Validates schema
- Ensures numeric severity values
- Parses timestamps
- Rejects malformed inputs

---

### Option B — Load Simulated Dataset

Load a pre-configured enterprise demo dataset including:

- Fraud signals  
- Misinformation alerts  
- Mental health risk indicators  
- Infrastructure service load spikes  

This demonstrates multi-domain enterprise ingestion.

---

### 2️⃣ Risk Enrichment Pipeline

Each signal undergoes deterministic enrichment.

#### Risk Tier Classification

| Severity Score | Risk Tier |
|---------------|-----------|
| ≥ 0.9         | Critical  |
| 0.7 – 0.89    | High      |
| 0.4 – 0.69    | Medium    |
| < 0.4         | Low       |

This classification is rule-based and fully transparent.

---

#### Anomaly Flag

High-deviation signals are flagged for priority review.

---

#### Confidence Score

Severity represents intensity of risk.  
Confidence represents certainty of classification.  

They are intentionally separated to prevent overreaction to uncertain signals.

---

### 3️⃣ Critical Alert Extraction

Signals above defined thresholds are:

- Sorted by severity  
- Highlighted for executive visibility  
- Structured for response prioritization  

---

### 4️⃣ Decision Card Generator

The Decision Card transforms signals into structured governance summaries including:

- Category  
- Risk Tier  
- Severity  
- Confidence  
- Enterprise Impact  
- Recommended Intervention  
- Escalation Requirement  

AI generates recommendations.  
Humans make final decisions.

## 🏛 Responsible AI & Governance

Aegis AI is built on enterprise governance principles.

### Privacy by Design
- Stateless processing  
- No personal data stored by default  
- Configurable retention policies  

### Human-in-the-Loop
- AI recommends  
- Humans approve  
- Critical tiers require explicit authorization  

### Audit Logging
- Timestamped classifications  
- Decision traceability  
- Immutable log concept
