Update my Streamlit app to look more enterprise and gold tier.

IMPORTANT
Do NOT rewrite the whole project.
Only make targeted edits in src/logic.py and src/ui.py.
Keep existing styling and navigation.
After edits, app must still run with: streamlit run app.py with no crashes.

PART A: Risk Analysis page upgrades (Decision Card)

1) Executive level explanation wording
In src/logic.py update generate_ai_explanation(category, severity_score, anomaly, description) so that:
- Wording depends on risk level computed from severity_score:
  - Medium: “Elevated risk requiring monitoring.”
  - High: “Escalation threshold exceeded. Material operational risk.”
  - Critical: “Immediate action required. Potential systemic impact.”
- Always ends with: “Recommendation is advisory and requires human review.”
- If anomaly is true, add: “Anomaly detected: behavior deviates significantly from baseline.”
- Keep text professional and concise.

2) Show anomaly and key fields explicitly in Decision Card
In src/ui.py where Decision Card is rendered, add lines for:
- Category: <category>
- Severity Score: <severity_score rounded to 2 decimals>
- Anomaly Detected: Yes or No
- Estimated Enterprise Impact: <impact level from mapping below>

3) Add Model Transparency panel
In the Decision Card, add an st.expander titled “Model Transparency” with bullets:
- Inputs evaluated: category, severity_score, description
- Risk tiering: deterministic thresholds (Low <0.35, Medium <0.6, High <0.8, Critical >=0.8)
- Anomaly detection: category specific thresholds and score >=0.9
- Confidence: heuristic calibration based on severity and anomaly
- Human in the loop: required for final decision

4) Make risk level visually strong
When displaying risk level, use Streamlit status components:
- Low -> st.success
- Medium -> st.info
- High -> st.warning
- Critical -> st.error

5) Sort enriched results by severity_score descending
In src/ui.py after enrichment, sort by severity_score descending before displaying.

6) Highlight critical rows
If dataframe styling is possible, highlight rows where risk_level == “Critical”.
If styling is limited, add a separate table “Critical Alerts” filtered to Critical and show it above the main table.

7) Add Enterprise Impact Estimate logic
In src/logic.py add a function or mapping:
- Low -> Minor
- Medium -> Moderate
- High -> Significant
- Critical -> Severe
Show it in the Decision Card.

8) Add Audit Log simulation in Decision Card
In Decision Card show:
“Audit Log: Event recorded at <current timestamp>”
Do not store anything, just display.

PART B: Demo Mode upgrades (guided incident response)

Only update the Demo Mode page in src/ui.py.

1) Add a Scenario Summary section at the top with:
- Scenario Loaded: <scenario name>
- Executive Summary: 2 to 3 sentences summarizing top risks and recommended response
- Primary Categories: top 2 categories with counts

2) Improve top alert cards in Demo Mode
For the top 3 critical alerts, show in each card:
- Category
- Severity
- Risk
- Confidence
- Anomaly Detected: Yes or No
- Estimated Impact: Minor/Moderate/Significant/Severe
- Recommended Owner Team: Comms / IT Ops / Student Services / Security
- SLA: Critical = 1 hour, High = 24 hours

3) Add Recommended Actions Queue table in Demo Mode
Add a table titled “Recommended Actions Queue” with columns:
action, owner, sla, status
Populate it automatically based on the top 3 critical alerts.
Status default: Pending.

4) Structure Demo Mode sections in this order:
- Scenario Summary
- Top Critical Alerts (Immediate Action Required)
- Recommended Actions Queue
- Anomalies Detected table (existing)
- SDG Alignment (existing)
- Live Demo Script (existing or add if missing)

5) Add a visible Live Demo Script text area
Label: “Live Demo Script”
Pre fill with a 30 to 45 second script tailored to the selected scenario, mentioning:
- proactive detection
- enterprise governance
- human in the loop
- SDG alignment

After making these changes, verify no errors and that both Risk Analysis and Demo Mode still work.
