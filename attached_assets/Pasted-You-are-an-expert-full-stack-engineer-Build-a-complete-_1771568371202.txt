You are an expert full stack engineer. Build a complete, runnable Streamlit app in Python called:

Aegis AI – Enterprise Risk & Harm Prevention Platform

Goal:
A polished hackathon demo that looks enterprise grade, demonstrates responsible AI governance, includes SDG alignment, and shows enterprise thinking: scalability, reliability, and security. The app must run locally with:
streamlit run app.py

Hard Requirements:
1) Create these files and folders exactly:
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- src/
  - __init__.py
  - logic.py
  - data.py
  - ui.py
- assets/
  - sample_signals.csv

2) The app must have sidebar navigation with 5 pages:
- Overview
- Risk Analysis
- Responsible AI & Governance
- Enterprise Architecture
- Demo Mode

3) Overview page must include:
- Title and subtitle
- 4 KPI metrics using st.metric:
  - Active Risk Signals
  - High Severity Alerts
  - Avg Confidence
  - System Status (Operational)
- A risk trend chart using st.line_chart from simulated data
- A short “Why this matters” section in professional tone

4) Risk Analysis page must include:
- Option A: Upload CSV
- Option B: Use built in simulated dataset button
- Display the dataframe preview
- Validate required columns and show a clear error if missing:
  required columns: timestamp, category, severity_score, description
- For each record compute:
  - risk_level in {Low, Medium, High, Critical}
  - anomaly_flag boolean
  - confidence_score between 0.55 and 0.95
- Show a table with these outputs
- Let user click a selected row index and generate a “Decision Card” containing:
  - Risk level
  - AI explanation
  - Recommended intervention
  - Confidence score
  - Model transparency panel that lists which inputs were used

5) Responsible AI & Governance page must include these sections with bullets:
- Privacy by design (no default storage of personal data, redaction guidance)
- Human in the loop policy (AI suggests, humans decide)
- Bias and fairness considerations (avoid targeting protected groups, monitor drift)
- Audit logging plan (what would be logged and why)
- Failure modes and mitigations (false positives, hallucinations, over reliance)

6) Enterprise Architecture page must include:
- A clear architecture diagram rendered using st.markdown in ASCII or Mermaid-like text
- Describe:
  - Stateless API layer
  - Scalable inference service
  - Encrypted storage
  - Role based access control
  - Monitoring and alerting
  - Rate limiting
- Add “Why IBM Z” section explaining suitability for mission critical workloads and secure high volume processing in finance and healthcare
- Add a small “Business Model” section with a tiered SaaS plan

7) Demo Mode page must be a clean scripted demo:
- Buttons:
  - Load University Exam Stress Scenario
  - Load Healthcare Capacity Scenario
  - Load Financial Fraud Scenario
- Each scenario loads a dataset and automatically highlights:
  - top 3 critical risks
  - anomalies
- Display a short pitch script text box that I can read during the live demo
- Include SDG alignment text for each scenario

8) Data and logic:
- In src/data.py:
  - function load_sample_csv() reads assets/sample_signals.csv
  - function generate_simulated_signals(n:int, scenario:str) returns a pandas DataFrame with required columns
- In src/logic.py:
  - function calculate_risk_level(score:float) returns Low Medium High Critical based on thresholds:
    Low < 0.35
    Medium < 0.6
    High < 0.8
    Critical >= 0.8
  - function detect_anomaly(score:float, category:str) uses category specific thresholds and also flags score >= 0.9 as anomaly
  - function compute_confidence(score:float, anomaly:bool) returns confidence 0.55 to 0.95
  - function redact_sensitive(text:str) removes emails and phone like patterns
  - function generate_ai_explanation(category, severity_score, anomaly, description) returns a professional explanation and includes a caution line: “Recommendation is advisory and requires human review.”
  - function recommend_intervention(category, risk_level, anomaly) returns concrete enterprise interventions
- In src/ui.py:
  - functions that render each page so app.py remains clean

9) assets/sample_signals.csv:
Create a realistic CSV with at least 25 rows, mix of categories:
- mental_health
- service_load
- fraud
- misinformation
Include timestamps, severity_score values 0 to 1, and descriptions that look realistic but do NOT contain real personal data.

10) Quality constraints:
- Must not crash if user uploads bad file: show friendly errors
- Must not require any external API keys
- Must be deterministic and stable
- Use only standard libraries plus: streamlit, pandas, numpy
- requirements.txt must list exact packages needed
- All code must be well commented and readable

11) Visual polish:
- Use st.container, st.columns, st.divider, st.info, st.warning, st.success
- Use consistent wording: “signals”, “risk”, “intervention”, “confidence”
- Add a small footer: “Aegis AI demo. Not for clinical or legal decisions.”

Deliverables:
Return the full contents of all files: app.py, requirements.txt, src/logic.py, src/data.py, src/ui.py, src/__init__.py, assets/sample_signals.csv

After generating code, include brief run instructions:
1) pip install -r requirements.txt
2) streamlit run app.py
